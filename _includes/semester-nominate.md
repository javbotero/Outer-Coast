# Nominate a Student for the Outer Coast Semester 

Nominations are the most effective way for us to reach potential student applicants and provide them with information about the Outer Coast Semester. If you are an educator who would like to nominate a student for our program, you can do so here.

Please note that nominations do not impact a studentâ€™s chances of being admitted to the program and that students do not need to be nominated in order to apply to the program.

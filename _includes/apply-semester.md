# Apply to the Outer Coast Semester

#### Eligibility

High school graduates are eligible to apply. We are looking for students who want to develop their critical thinking, listening, and communication skills while engaging with the communities around them, both big and small. We place a special emphasis on recruiting students from under-resourced backgrounds. Students do not need to be nominated to apply.

#### Application Process

Applications are available September 1st.

To hear back by mid-October, submit your application by September 30, 2019. The application closes on November 15, 2019 and all decisions will be made by December 1, 2019, but students who apply earlier could hear back earlier.

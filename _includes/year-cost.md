# Cost of Attendance

The Outer Coast Year does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we ask that the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) work with Outer Coast to establish a cost of attendance based on their household’s financial means. This cost of attendance includes academic tuition, room, and board for the duration of the student’s attendance. Outer Coast will share a Cost of Attendance questionnaire for students to complete after offers of admission have been made.

**Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Cost will not be a barrier to attendance.**

Outer Coast admissions decisions are determined through a need-blind process. This means that what the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) are able to pay will not influence the student’s chances of admission.

Outer Coast is excited to partner with the Sealaska Heritage Institute in order to offer its first Tlingit Language open online course. Kashook’ Áa Ḵaa Ee Dultóowu Yé will offer an opportunity for all levels of language learners to practice Tlingit in a welcoming online environment. MCed by X̱’unei Lance Twitchell, this course will invite elders and other teachers from across Southeast Alaska to lead classes and share their knowledge. The course will also facilitate specialized conversation sections where learners of all levels can practice the language with others of their ability.

*Kashook’ Áa Ḵaa Ee Dultóowu Yé* is offered at no cost to all who wish to participate.

You can sign up for this course below, and Outer Coast will follow up with you by email with more instructions on how to enroll.

*The Tlingit language MOOC is an effort to provide content to a wide audience and continue to explore how education can be a vessel where Alaska Native languages thrive and reach all those in need of the cherished voices of those who came before us as well as those who have yet to arrive.*

*Many of our languages are threatened with extinction, and being unable to be in the same physical space as those who are learning has the potential to accelerate language death. This MOOC is a step to mediate language loss, and it can create a model of delivery for other Alaska Native languages.*

*There are fewer than 100 people who can speak Lingít (Tlingit) at an advanced level, so it is critical to attempt to create access to learning opportunities without barriers of time, space, and cost.*

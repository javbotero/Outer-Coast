<strong>Imagining Otherwise: Utopia and Apocalypse in a Changing World</strong>

[Sol Neely](http://www.uas.alaska.edu/dir/sjneely.html), Associate Professor of English and Philosophy, University of Alaska Southeast

Many of the world’s problems today are the result of a collapsed political imagination, which occasions a fundamental inability to imagine society otherwise than what we’ve inherited. This course will ask students to identify contemporary social problems in their genealogical contexts and boldly imagine projects of social transformation that address these issues.

<strong>The Most Important Question</strong>

[Jenell Paris](https://www.messiah.edu/a/academics/facultydir/faculty_profile.php?directoryID=9&entryID=642), Professor of Anthropology, Messiah College

This course relies on the inquiry method of anthropological study to guide students toward asking important questions and seeking answers. Students will reflect on the social construction of knowledge and societal priorities by reading works that explore nature, indigeneity, and self-reflection in several cultural traditions.

<strong>Tlingit Language & Indigenous Studies</strong>

[X'unei Lance Twitchell](http://www.uas.alaska.edu/dir/latwitchell.html), Associate Professor of Alaska Native Languages, University of Alaska Southeast

This seminar teaches students the Tlingit language and also introduces a number of critical concepts in the field of Indigenous Studies. The daily activities of the class will be divided between language learning and use, and the exploration of topics in Indigenous Studies in a place-based and safe learning environment. 

X'unei taught at the inaugural Summer Seminar in 2018, and we are excited to welcome him back to Sitka this summer!

We anticipate that students will be able to earn college credit for their coursework this summer.

**Outer Coast Year Course Announcement**

While we are still in the midst of finalizing our slate of courses for the Year, we’re excited to announce our first confirmed course!


**Bodies and Boundaries**

Katherine Ding, Department of English - University of California, Berkeley

Bodies are defined by their boundaries. We maintain our sense of integrity — as individuals and as a body politic — by continuously enforcing these boundaries and by imagining ourselves to be separate from the bodies existing beyond the lines we draw. But in an age of ecological disaster and mass global displacements, these assumptions are no longer tenable. Our course offers a bold thought experiment that we will collectively examine and revise: what happens if we stop enforcing these boundaries and instead embrace the body as a shifting material being in constant exchange with its environment, and thus whose boundaries are always porous and in flux?



Bodies and Boundaries will be offered in the second term of the Spring Semester, spanning March 23 to May 7.

We will share additional program updates soon. In the meantime, we hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times.



Wishing you all the best,

The Outer Coast Team

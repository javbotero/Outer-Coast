#### Eligibility & Accessibility

Current high school sophomores and juniors are eligible to apply. We hope to bring together high-potential students who are invested in community. We place a special emphasis on recruiting students from underserved backgrounds.
The student body will be limited to Western Hemisphere time zones, to avoid asynchronous learning and maximize real-time community building.

Outer Coast is committed to the virtual accessibility of the Summer Seminar for all students. As such, Outer Coast will work to provide access to the technology required for full participation in the Summer Seminar. 

If you are unable to apply online, or would prefer to apply by mail, please contact johnny@outercoast.org to request a paper application.

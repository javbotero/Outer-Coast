<strong>Educational Model</strong>

Over the course of five weeks, students immerse themselves in two fast-paced, college-level academic courses; participate in a meaningful, work-based service program; and explore the powers and responsibilities of self-governance. Both inside and outside the classroom, Summer Seminar students will learn how to identify, analyze, and respond to the challenges that face the world today.

<i>Imagining Otherwise: Utopia and Apocalypse in a Changing World</i>

Many of the world’s problems today are the result of a collapsed political imagination, which occasions a fundamental inability to imagine society otherwise than what we’ve inherited. This course will ask students to identify contemporary social problems in their genealogical contexts and boldly imagine projects of social transformation that address these issues.

<i>The Most Important Question</i>

This course relies on the inquiry method of anthropological study to guide students toward asking important questions and seeking answers. Students will reflect on the social construction of knowledge and societal priorities by reading works that explore nature, indigeneity, and self-reflection in several cultural traditions.

<i>Tlingit Language & Indigenous Studies</i>

This seminar teaches students the Tlingit language and also introduces a number of critical concepts in the field of Indigenous Studies. The daily activities of the class will be divided between language learning and use, and the exploration of topics in Indigenous Studies in a place-based and safe learning environment.

With COVID-19 continuing to threaten communities across Alaska, ongoing Tlingit language revitalization efforts are particularly at risk. Many Tlingit culture camps and language study opportunities have been cancelled or postponed this summer, and elders are more isolated from the communities with which they usually share their knowledge.

<!--more-->

In response, we are partnering with the Sealaska Heritage Institute to co-host Kashook’ Áa Ḵaa Ee Dultóowu Yé, a Tlingit Language Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for language learners in Sitka, Southeast, and beyond.

Led by Outer Coast faculty member and UAS Associate Professor of Alaska Native Languages X̱’unei Lance Twitchell, the MOOC will be accessible at no cost for all participants. The course will run five days a week for Tlingit language learners of any level of proficiency, with live lessons on Tuesdays and Thursday and small conversation groups segmented by ability on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Recordings will also be made available.

We will also work alongside our partners to connect with elders in order to bring their knowledge into the MOOC. We are committed to providing the technology and connectivity support for any elder interested in joining the MOOC, whether that be through MiFi internet access or tablets and laptops. Reach out to us if you or any elder you know may be interested.

We look forward to offering Kashook’ Áa Ḵaa Ee Dultóowu Yé this summer and hopefully seeing you there. If you would like to support Outer Coast’s capacity to offer this course, consider making a contribution below.

All the best,

The Outer Coast Team

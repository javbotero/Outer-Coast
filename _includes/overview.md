### Outer Coast Summer Seminar 2020: Overview

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar offers a diverse cohort of Alaskan, Lower 48, and international high school students (current sophomores and juniors) a transformative academic and service based experience that is founded on the belief that students should have agency and ownership of every aspect of their academic and personal lives and the responsibility to positively affect the communities to which they belong.

Due to circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, and concerns for the health and safety of Outer Coast students, faculty and staff, and the community of Sitka, we will be moving forward with a virtual program for students to participate in from home. This program will be a unique endeavor, designed for this specific moment in time — but will maintain the dynamic learning environment of past Summer Seminars. In the interest of best serving our students we are crafting a program with a focus on promoting intellectual engagement, purpose, and belonging during this uncertain time.

Over the course of five weeks, students immerse themselves in three fast-paced, college-level academic courses; engage virtually in service to their communities and to the community of Sitka; and explore the powers and responsibilities of self-governance. Both inside and outside the classroom, Summer Seminar students will learn how to identify, analyze, and respond to the challenges that face the world today.

<strong>Eligibility & Accessibility</strong>

Current high school sophomores and juniors are eligible to apply. We hope to bring together high-potential students who are invested in community. We place a special emphasis on recruiting students from underserved backgrounds.
The student body will be limited to Western Hemisphere time zones, to avoid asynchronous learning and maximize real-time community building.

Outer Coast is committed to the virtual accessibility of the Summer Seminar for all students. As such, Outer Coast will work to provide access to the technology required for full participation in the Summer Seminar. 
If you are unable to apply online, or would prefer to apply by mail, please contact johnny@outercoast.org to request a paper application.

**Intro to Applied Economics – The Economics of Rural Alaskan Water Utilities**

In this course, students will learn applied economics by exploring the economics of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems in Alaska. Alaska has the highest rate of households without in-home access to drinking water and sanitation services in the United States. Why? We will answer this question using economics, which is the study of how we, as individuals or as a society, decide to allocate resources. We will learn about economies of scale, incentives, prices, and the laws of demand and supply. We will touch on the cultural dimension of economics and the colonial roots of infrastructure development in rural Alaska. Students will also collaborate on a research project, which will be published. By the end of this course students will be thinking like economists.


**Indigenizing Futures: Healing Within and Against the Anthropocene**

The term “Anthropocene,” which has gained a lot of traction both for climate scientists and activists, occasions an important critical framework for rendering legible the role of human development in visibly affecting the geological record. However, the term has also come under scrutiny by Indigenous scholars and activists who see it as both irreducibly Eurocentric and as obscuring long Indigenous traditions of climate justice and stewardship. In this seminar, we will take up these Indigenous critiques within and against appeal to the Anthropocene. We will begin by analyzing global climate change as an extension and intensification of colonialism, giving due critical attention to the economic, environmental, and cultural sorrows of late-stage capitalism. Then, we will draw from a broad array of interdisciplinary and Indigenous source materials — from origin stories to Indigenous futurisms — in order to imagine decolonial futures rooted in Indigenous land management, economic equity, and environmental justice.


**Living a Democratic Life**

  _Joel Schlosser, Associate Professor of Political Science, Bryn Mawr College_

What are we talking about when we talk about democracy? This course will examine the history, theory, and practice of democracy from its origins in ancient Athens to the present day. Is democracy a matter of political institutions or does it require a particular culture and set of beliefs? What obligations does a citizen of a democracy have? Do we even want to live in a democracy? Approaching these questions from a variety of angles, we will also seek to reflect on the powers and responsibilities of self-governance at Outer Coast. What does it mean to participate in a self-governing community? How can self-governance at Outer Coast inform governance in political life more broadly? Readings will include ancient Greek drama and philosophy, American history and literature, and contemporary film.


**Tlingit Language and Indigenous Studies**

This course will be an intensive that teaches students the Tlingit language and also introduces a number of critical    concepts in the field of Indigenous Studies. The daily activities of the class will be divided between language learning and use and the exploration of topics in Indigenous Studies in a place-based and safe learning environment.

# Outer Coast

### What if we could start over with higher education?

<!-- First paragraph requires special HTML -->
<div class="first-p">
  <strong>We love our colleges and universities.</strong> After all, college is where we solidify our deepest beliefs and forge our dearest friendships. It’s where many of us proudly take responsibility for our lives for the first time. Long after graduation, we recall our college years with fondness.

But many of us know that these rosy feelings mask the truth about higher education in the United States—that it’s showing its wear. Crises loom:

[Films](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLdU7uts4ws) have been shot, [articles](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/28/the-cost-of-college) have been written, [bills](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/28/the-cost-of-college) have been passed. But these problems persist, to the point where they can seem intractable.

We think otherwise. We think a college education can be affordable and transformative, intellectually and personally. To prove it, we’re building a college of our own.

## Three Pillars

Outer Coast is a nascent two-year institution of higher education in Sitka, Alaska. Our curriculum is one for the whole person, built upon the three pillars of __Academics__, __Service & Labor__, and __Self-governance__.

We draw our inspiration from [Deep Springs College](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/the-searchers-2), a unique postsecondary institution nestled in a desert valley just east of the Sierra Nevada. Although remarkably successful and widely admired, nearly a century after its founding Deep Springs remains the only college of its kind.

Today's universities function more as sprawling conglomerates than as schools: they manage multi-million-dollar athletic programs, police departments, hospitals, science research facilities, massive food and residential services operations, and sprawling real estate portfolios. Meanwhile, the academic job market often discourages great teaching by providing incentives for faculty to focus primarily on research.

Our vision with Outer Coast is to create a relentlessly student-focused institution. Outer Coast faculty’s foremost obligation will be to provide a dazzling, neuron-bending intellectual experience for students, and to treat teaching as a craft in its own right. At Outer Coast, excellence in teaching is the priority.

After two years, we want Outer Coast students to have the option to transfer to four-year institutions, where they can take advantage of the resources of a larger institution. This model aspires to be the “best of the both worlds”: students can complete a robust two-year liberal arts education without crippling debt, then transition into two years of a traditional undergraduate education with a far clearer sense of themselves.

**The Summer Seminar is an immersive opportunity for rising high school juniors and seniors to get a taste of the college experience — and shape it for themselves.**

Over the course of an intensive month, up to 20 students undertake fast-paced, intellectually rigorous academic coursework; engage in work-based service and meaningful labor in Sitka; and practice self-governance of key elements of Outer Coast. Through a small seminar, close-knit residential living, and involvement in the wider Sitka community, Outer Coast students learn how to identify, analyze, and address the challenges — both big and small — that face the world today. Rising high school juniors and seniors participate alongside high school graduates and build mutually beneficial near-peer mentorship bonds. 

In the fast-paced Summer Seminar environment, students earn college credit, practice the mechanics of making change, and build meaningful relationships as part of an intentional learning community. 

**How To Do Nothing: Work, Refusal, and Politics**

*Profs. Lizzie Krontiris and Joel Schlosser*

“Nothing is harder to do these days than nothing,” writes Jenny Odell in How To Do Nothing. Everything vies for our attention: important news, exciting updates from friends, cat videos, advertisements. How could we possibly do nothing when there’s always something? And shouldn’t we be doing something? This course investigates how and why doing nothing might be the most important thing to do at a time when it feels like there’s so much to do. Thinking with classic and contemporary texts, we will also experiment with different forms of writing that avoid just doing something and instead cultivate attention and intention. In dialogue with Odell’s book, this course will investigate the role that work plays in contemporary life and the capitalist imperative to be productive and keep busy; the resistance and refusal of “doing nothing”; and how we might imagine and pursue more ecological and just ways of living together.

*It has been the most formative experience I’ve ever had in such a short span of time. It showed me what was valuable in my life: learning, meaningful relationships, meaningful work, and that creating a society, even temporarily, of all these things is possible.*

**— Rebecca, Summer Seminar 2018 and Outer Coast Year 2021-22 student from Phoenix, AZ**

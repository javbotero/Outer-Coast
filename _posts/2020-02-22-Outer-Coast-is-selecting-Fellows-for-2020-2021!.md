We’re growing! Outer Coast has already taken many steps on our path to founding a two-year, liberal arts college in Sitka, Alaska that inspires students to create virtuous change in their own lives and in the world, but there’s much more work to be done!

If you are interested in becoming part of this effort and making significant contributions to our vision and future programs, apply to join our team through the [Alaska Fellows Program](http://alaskafellows.org/).

We are seeking self-motivated individuals who are passionate about innovation in higher education to fill two roles:

<strong> [The Outer Coast Development and Administration Fellow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBNcuQSe7UcO8kuHvtXuD1l7SHFT8c1axBIkUD1U_II/edit) </strong> will manage donor relationships, apply for grants, and fine-tune essential organizational systems.

<strong> [The Outer Coast Programs and Operations Fellow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTx3VKfctmuzvsaiT6xH0FrF2BTO95S8MnZ-R9VOwZg/edit) </strong> will design future programs and help develop Outer Coast’s structures for pedagogy, student life, student recruitment, and accreditation.

For both positions, the deadline to apply is <strong> March 15, 2020 </strong>.

Reach out to Johnny Elliott at johnny@outercoast.org if you have any questions about the roles or the Alaska Fellows Program.

All the best,

The Outer Coast Team

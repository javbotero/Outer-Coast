### Outer Coast Summer Seminar 2018

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar offers a diverse cohort of Alaskan and Lower 49 high school students (current sophomores and juniors) a transformative academic experience and the opportunity to engage with the world they are about to inherit. 

Over the course of four weeks, students immerse themselves in a fast-paced, college-level academic course; experiment with limited powers of self-governance; and participate in a meaningful service program.

The goals for the Summer Seminar are threefold: to bring together a diverse cohort of curious and motivated high school students and create a community of learning; to offer a transformative, community-centered educational opportunity that inspires students to become forces for positive change within their own communities; and to increase the likelihood that Summer Seminar students matriculate at college by introducing them to college-level academic work and orienting them to the college admissions process.

The Summer Seminar academic course offering is *Perspectives on Freedom, Authority, and Polarization*, co-taught by X̱’unei Lance Twitchell (joining us for the first portion of the seminar) and Sharon Schuman.

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar does not have a fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we ask that the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) complete the appropriate form to set their own cost of attendance based on their household’s financial means. This form will be sent to the student once their application has been reviewed. Outer Coast will meet the financial need of all students. Cost will not be a barrier to attendance. 

The Summer Seminar runs July 6 - August 4, 2018 in Sitka, Alaska.

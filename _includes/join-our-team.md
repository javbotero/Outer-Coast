Outer Coast seeks faculty to develop and teach engaging and innovative college-level courses during the Outer Coast Year. Faculty are encouraged to augment their course with visits from experts, both in person and virtually. 

Faculty will be aided by a Teaching Assistant (TA), who will assist in teaching and supporting students both in and out of the classroom. In addition to teaching the course, faculty will supervise the TA and will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the Outer Coast and Sitka communities. Faculty and TAs will be supported by the Outer Coast leadership and staff.

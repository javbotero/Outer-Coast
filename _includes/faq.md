### Where can I read more?

[Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/11/outer-coast-college-seeks-replicate-deep-springs-success), [Sitka Sentinel](http://sitkasentinel.com/7/2012-05-10-22-08-10/local-news/9434-group-targets-sj-campus-for-new-college), and [Alaska Dispatch News](http://www.adn.com/article/20151217/lawmaker-plans-new-unusual-private-college-sitka) have all covered Outer Coast.

### Do you have a campus?

We're talking about it! The nationally renowned Sitka Fine Arts Camp owns and is restoring the Sheldon Jackson Campus. We are both excited about the possibility of Outer Coast on Sheldon Jackson Campus, but nothing is decided and there are many important details to work through.

### Where is the campus?

Sheldon Jackson Campus is in the heart of Sitka, Alaska, a few hundred meters from Sitka’s downtown and bordering the beautiful Sitka National Historical Park.

### When do you start taking applications?

At the earliest, fall 2017, with admitted students enrolling in fall 2018. We want to emphasize that this is the most optimistic possible timeline.

If you’re interested in applying, <a href="{{ site.root }}/contact.html" class="blue-grey-text body-link">let us know</a>. We’ll keep in touch and contact you when applications are open.

### Will there be any gender-based eligibility requirements?

No, none at all. A point of differentiation from Deep Springs, Outer Coast welcomes all students, regardless of gender.

### Will credits from Outer Coast be transferable to four-year universities?

Yes. Outer Coast is exploring accreditation through partner institutions, simultaneous to the larger process of applying for independent accreditation.

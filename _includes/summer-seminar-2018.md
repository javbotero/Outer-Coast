<strong>Academics</strong> 

The academic program consists of one college-level course that introduces students to rigorous, discussion-based learning and requires them to fully engage the material, their peers, and the faculty. The course is determined by the selected pair of faculty who have terminal degrees in their respective fields and extensive teaching experience. Students receive additional academic support and mentorship from the residential teaching assistants (RTAs), who serve as tutors and run study hall.

Students also have an opportunity outside the classroom to learn more about the college experience during a series of one-hour workshops on the college admissions and financial aid processes. 

<strong>Service</strong> 

Through participation in service projects, students experience the value of meaningful, hands-on community engagement. Students spend a portion of each day working on one or both community-based service projects, including local trail work and building restoration on the Sitka Fine Arts Campus. A service coordinator provides oversight and guidance through the duration of the program and supports the development of skills associated with each project.

<strong>Self-governance</strong>

Summer Seminar students are vested with responsibility to help govern their own community. RTAs facilitate the self-governing process but ultimately empower students to make and implement community decisions and navigate their consequences. The self-governance pillar is an opportunity for students to develop communication and leadership skills and mature as young adults.

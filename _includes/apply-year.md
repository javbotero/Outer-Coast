The application for the Outer Coast Year 2022-23 will open on January 7, 2022. Check back to access the application. 

**Preliminary applications are due by 11:59 pm AKDT on March 15, 2022. All preliminary applications submitted after March 15, 2022 will be considered on a rolling basis.**

**Application Process**

The Outer Coast Year application process consists of a preliminary application, a secondary application, and an interview. All applications are reviewed thoroughly and holistically by the joint student-staffulty Applications Committee (AppComm).

The preliminary application requires some basic information about applicants and their interest in Outer Coast and serves to communicate a number of core tenets of the Outer Coast Year to applicants.

After completing a preliminary application, applicants may be invited to complete a secondary application, which includes a number of short-answer and essay questions. At this stage, we also ask for a high school transcript and any other postsecondary transcripts, as well as at least one recommendation from a teacher. The secondary application is intended to give applicants the opportunity to expand on their interest in Outer Coast, their preparedness academically and socially for the Outer Coast community, and their ability to persevere through challenges. 

Within two weeks of submitting the secondary application, applicants may be invited to an interview with 2-3 members of AppComm. AppComm aims to create a welcoming environment during the interview, in which the main goal is to learn more about the applicant and their interest in joining the Outer Coast community. Applicants may bring any and all questions they have about Outer Coast to the interview in addition to the questions AppComm members will have for applicants. 

Outer Coast Year applicants who wish to receive a decision by the end of April 2022 must submit a preliminary application by the priority application deadline on **March 15, 2022.** All preliminary applications received after March 15 will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

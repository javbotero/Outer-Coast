This moment in our journey as an institution marks a renewed focus on intentional, transformational teaching. Qualified applicants must be committed teachers who have experience in a seminar-style setting, working with innovative pedagogical models, and supporting the development of students from a broad range of backgrounds. We are also seeking faculty with an interest in contributing to the long-term pedagogical vision of Outer Coast.

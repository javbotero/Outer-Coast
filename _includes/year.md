**The Outer Coast Year is a transformative, community-based, student-governed education for high school graduates.**
 
The Year offers a one- or two-semester bridge for students to grow academically and personally in a supportive postsecondary  environment. The Year gives students the time and perspective to approach their next steps, whether college or another path, with purpose and confidence. After their time at the Year, students discover more of what they want out of higher education and are prepared to advocate for themselves and for others, wherever their futures take them. 
 
Year students spend nine months building academic skills and mindsets in a tight-knit and supportive college-level environment that empowers them to make real-stakes decisions, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. Cohorts of up to 20 students — some having just graduated high school, others already with some college experience — come together in Sitka for a formative year of education.
 
The Year consists of Fall and Spring Semesters, each with discrete classes and faculty. Students walk away from the Year with college credit and the preparation necessary to make the most of their opportunities in higher education.

*The Year was transformative. I learned a lot about how I react to different environments and new challenges. It’s challenged me to be a stronger part of a community. Prior to coming to Outer Coast, it was easy to take a backseat and let others take the lead. Outer Coast challenged me to step up.*

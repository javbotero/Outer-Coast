Dear Friends of Outer Coast,

After much consideration, we have concluded that we will not be able to run the 2020 Summer Seminar in-person in Sitka as originally conceived. This was a difficult decision to make, but protecting the health and safety of Outer Coast students, staffulty, and the community of Sitka makes it the right one. 

Instead we will be offering a <strong>virtual</strong> model of the 2020 Summer Seminar, created in cooperation with our alumni and staffulty.

<strong>And we are still accepting student applications!</strong>

Now that students will be able to participate from home, we are reopening the application for the Summer Seminar. We hope to fill our few remaining spots as quickly as possible. The application deadline is <strong>Sunday, May 31, 2020</strong>.

<strong>Virtual Summer Seminar 2020</strong>

Guided by four Outer Coast faculty members and six Summer Seminar Advisors, students will engage with academics, service, and self-governance — our three pillars — throughout the Summer Seminar. They will choose from a slate of stellar academic course offerings, execute project-based virtual service for the community of Sitka, and design integral components of future Outer Coast programs, all while building a community of learning online.

The virtual Summer Seminar 2020 will be a unique endeavor, designed specifically for this moment in time to address the social impact of the pandemic and to bring energizing, cooperative learning to the virtual world.

<strong>In the words of Michaela, a 2018 Summer Seminar alumna from Willow, Alaska:</strong>

When I heard the seminar would be online, I began wondering how service would be done virtually. I remember learning so much from the service projects I did as a student, so I knew the program just wouldn’t be right without it. Then I discovered that Outer Coast was looking for input from alums, and I knew it was my chance to help make the service pillar happen, even with the challenges of this year. 

I’m excited to be a part of the Summer Seminar because I want this year’s students to have the same chance that I did to learn through service.

If you have any questions about the application, the virtual program, or want to schedule a time to talk before applying, contact Johnny at johnny@outercoast.org.

All the best to you and your loved ones,

The Outer Coast Team

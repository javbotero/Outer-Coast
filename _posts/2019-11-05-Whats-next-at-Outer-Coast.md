Since early September, we have been in conversation with the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education (ACPE), pursuing the Alaska higher ed holy grail: Initial Authorization — a regulatory prerequisite to run any postsecondary program, including the Outer Coast Semester. We learned recently that this process cannot be completed before ACPE’s January meeting, and we will now wait to offer academic-year programming until Fall 2020.

We see this circumstance as disappointing but not discouraging, as it provides an opportunity to refocus our energies. Namely, we have the capacity to commit today to offer two Outer Coast programs in 2020: the Outer Coast Summer Seminar and, from Fall 2020 through Spring 2021, the Outer Coast Year.

With two summers now under our belt, we feel more equipped than ever to run a transformative Summer Seminar. Please spread the word to any high school sophomores or juniors you think would be a good fit to join us in Sitka this summer.

Beginning Fall 2020, the Outer Coast Year will serve high school graduates and resemble what Outer Coast will eventually look like as a college. In offering the Year, we’ll build off our plans for the Semester to create a fully immersive experience based on the pillars of academics, service & labor, and student self-governance. Students will contribute to the ultimate design of the college and have the opportunity to earn credits and to enroll in one or both semesters.

We plan to open the application for both the Summer Seminar and the Year in January 2020.

While our path has changed, our direction has not, and we remain as confident as ever about the future of Outer Coast.

Thank you for your support in making this vision a reality!

The Outer Coast Team

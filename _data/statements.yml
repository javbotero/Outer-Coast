  title: Brief History of the Project
  text: |
    Founded in 1878, Sheldon Jackson College was the oldest institution of higher learning in Alaska until its closure in 2007. Title to the deteriorating campus was transferred to the nationally recognized Sitka Fine Arts Camp.

    In the ensuing years, led by the inspiring vision of the Fine Arts Camp, the community of Sitka rallied to rejuvenate the campus in the largest singular volunteer effort in the history of Alaska.

    Today, the Sitka Fine Arts Camp runs its summer programs on the Sheldon Jackson Campus to national acclaim, filling Sitka with tremendous creative energy.

    In summer of 2014, Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins and Roger Schmidt began discussing the possibility of founding a new college on the campus in partnership with the Fine Arts Camp.

    In January of 2015, Jonathan visited Deep Springs College to explore the possibility of bringing the Deep Springs model to Sitka. At Deep Springs Jonathan met Will Hunt, a second year student who promptly committed to move to Sitka in the fall in order to examine the feasibility of creating a new Nunnian college on the Sheldon Jackson Campus.

    Jonathan, Will, and Javier Botero began working on the project in early September, 2015. In mid-November, the team organized a two-day meeting on the campus, inviting collaborators from Sitka, Alaska, and the lower 48 to review drafts of the curricular structure, accreditation timeline, admissions procedure, and much more.

    Following the November meeting Stephanie Gilardi joined the primary collaborator team. The team of four created seven committees, collectively charged with overseeing all aspects of the college-building process, from accreditation to pedagogy to fundraising.

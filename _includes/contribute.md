# Contribute

The vision for Outer Coast has made improbable progress over the last year and a half because many motivated people have pooled their time, dollars, and expertise. Would like to contribute to the cause?

## Legal & Graphic Design Help

Are you a lawyer with nonprofit experience? Are you a visual artist with experience in graphic design and logo design? Are you interested in collaborating with Outer Coast on a pro bono basis? If so, [please let us know]({{ site.root }}/contact.html).

## Donations

We also welcome early financial support. As we take steps forward with accreditation, Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education regulatory processes, incorporating as a nonprofit and writing bylaws, negotiating an MOU partnership with Sheldon Jackson Campus, and more, we increasingly need to match our sweat equity and pro bono contributions with financial contributions.

To make a financial contribution to Outer Coast, use the PayPal button below or send a check (made out to Outer Coast College) to this address:

> PO Box 6615  
> Sitka, AK 98835

We (and future generations of Outer Coast students) sincerely appreciate your support. Thank you!

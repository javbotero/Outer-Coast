[The Outer Coast Year](http://outercoast.org/year/) is our first postsecondary program, based on the pillars of intellectual inquiry, meaningful service and labor in the community, and student self-governance. Graduating high school seniors and recent high school graduates (including GED holders) who apply to the Outer Coast Year by this <strong> Saturday, February 29</strong>, will receive an admission decision by March 31, 2020. Students who apply after February 29 will receive an admission decision by June 1, 2020.

Interested students may apply online or print a mail-in application at [outercoast.org/year/apply](http://outercoast.org/year/apply/).

If you know a student who might be a good fit for Outer Coast, please forward them this email and/or nominate them at [outercoast.org/year/nominate](http://outercoast.org/year/nominate/).

We here in Sitka are excited to read the very first applications for this new program. This inaugural academic-year class will shape Outer Coastâ€™s future; we cannot wait to see how!

Looking forward,

The Outer Coast Team

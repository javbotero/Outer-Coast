# Nominate

Nominations are the most effective way for us to reach potential applicants and provide them with information about the Summer Seminar and the Outer Coast Year. If you would like to nominate a student for either the Summer Seminar or the Outer Coast Year, you can do so through the link above.

Please note that nominations do not affect a studentâ€™s chances of being admitted to either program and that students do not need to be nominated in order to apply.

# Means-based Cost of Attendance

Outer Coast programs have no fixed cost of attendance. Instead, we work with individual students and their families to establish a cost of attendance based on their householdâ€™s financial means. 

Outer Coast will meet 100% of demonstrated financial need for all students, including travel. 

**Cost will not be a barrier to attendance.**

Dear Friends of Outer Coast,

COVID-19 is in our communities and on all our minds. We at Outer Coast hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy in this challenging time. We are monitoring COVID-19 developments closely and working to understand the implications for future Outer Coast programs. At this point, we have determined that it is too early to make a call on the Summer Seminar and will continue in our preparations. If there are any changes to our plans, we will share updates immediately.

We have finalized our faculty and course offerings for the Summer Seminar and have an exceptional slate:

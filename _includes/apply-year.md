**Our Student Body**

Outer Coast students are intellectually curious, community-minded, and driven to create positive change in their lives and communities. 

Outer Coast seeks to serve a student body that is national and international in breadth and diverse in many ways, including racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender identities, and socioeconomic status. Outer Coast emphasizes reaching students from across Alaska, particularly Alaska Natives and rural Alaskans, as well as other high-potential students from backgrounds underrepresented and underserved in American higher education.

Admissions at Outer Coast are need-blind. 

**Eligibility**

Rising high school juniors and seniors, as well as all Outer Coast alumni who are still in high school, are eligible to apply for the Summer Seminar. Graduating seniors from Alaska are also eligible to apply for the Summer Seminar.

Any high school graduate or GED holder who has not yet completed a postsecondary degree is eligible for the Fall & Spring Semesters. Students may apply for either the Fall Semester, Spring Semester, or both, and preference may be given to applicants who apply for both semesters. Applicants may also opt to be considered for the Summer Seminar.

**Mail-In Application**

In addition to the online application above, Outer Coast offers the option for students to mail in their application. If you would like to apply to the Year by mail, you may print a Summer Seminar application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I96R_4cjjEVdFsBUQ68Y3GwuJsh0JXDM/view) or a Fall & Spring Semesters application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XBVrao4SEbOtfgurwFTTvkXW1ZBGF1o/view). Applications should be mailed to Outer Coast at PO Box 6573 Sitka, AK 99835 and postmarked by the application deadline.

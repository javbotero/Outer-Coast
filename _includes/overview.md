**The Summer Seminar is an immersive opportunity for rising high school juniors and seniors to get a taste of the college experience — and shape it for themselves.**

Over the course of an intensive month, up to 20 students undertake fast-paced, intellectually rigorous academic coursework; engage in work-based service and meaningful labor in Sitka; and practice self-governance of key elements of Outer Coast. Through a small seminar, close-knit residential living, and involvement in the wider Sitka community, Outer Coast students learn how to identify, analyze, and address the challenges — both big and small — that face the world today. Rising high school juniors and seniors participate alongside high school graduates and build mutually beneficial near-peer mentorship bonds. 

In the fast-paced Summer Seminar environment, students earn college credit, practice the mechanics of making change, and build meaningful relationships as part of an intentional learning community.

*It has been the most formative experience I’ve ever had in such a short span of time. It showed me what was valuable in my life: learning, meaningful relationships, meaningful work, and that creating a society, even temporarily, of all these things is possible.*

**— Rebecca, Summer Seminar 2018 and Outer Coast Year 2021-22 student from Phoenix, AZ**

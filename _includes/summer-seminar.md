### Outer Coast Summer Seminar 2018

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar offers a diverse cohort of Alaskan and Lower 49 high school students (rising juniors and seniors) a transformative academic experience and the opportunity to engage with the world they are about to inherit. 

Over the course of four weeks, students immerse themselves in a fast-paced, college-level academic course; experiment with limited powers of self-governance; and participate in a meaningful service program.

The goals for the Summer Seminar are threefold: to bring together a diverse cohort of curious and motivated high school students and create a community of learning; to offer a transformative, community-centered educational opportunity that inspires students to become forces for positive change within their own communities; and to increase the likelihood that Summer Seminar students matriculate at college by introducing them to college-level academic work and orienting them to the college admissions process.

The Summer Seminar runs July 6 - August 4, 2018 in Sitka, Alaska.

It’s official! Outer Coast just crossed two major milestones.

This past week, we opened [the application for the Outer Coast Year](http://outercoast.org/year/apply/) — an academic year program for high school graduates!

And in early January, the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education approved Initial Authorization for Outer Coast to host educational programs for high school graduates — clearing a major hurdle on the way to launching the college!

Starting this fall, [the Outer Coast Year](http://outercoast.org/year/) will expand upon our past experiences with the Summer Seminar and represent the most fully-fledged iteration of the Outer Coast model to date. Through engagement with their coursework, the Sitka community, and each other, students will both have the opportunity to strengthen their abilities to effect virtuous change and better understand their own place in the world more broadly.

Outer Coast will ensure that finances are not a barrier to anyone’s attendance by allowing students and their parent(s)/guardian(s) to [set their own cost of attendance](http://outercoast.org/cost-of-attendance.html) based on their household’s financial means and assisting with travel costs as appropriate.

The Year consists of two semesters:

_Fall Semester (August 31 to December 19, 2020)_

_Spring Semester (January 19 to May 8, 2021)_

Prospective high school graduates may apply for the Fall Semester, Spring Semester, or both. The Fall Semester/Full Year deadline is May 15, 2020, with applications submitted by February 29, 2020 receiving a decision by March 31, 2020. The Spring Semester application will remain open until September 30, 2020.


### Application Cycles ###

<strong>First cycle:</strong>

Application open until February 29, 2020. Decisions made by March 31, 2020.

<strong>Second cycle:</strong>

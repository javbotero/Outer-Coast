As the academic year wraps up (in a way none of us could have imagined), students around the world are wondering what‘s next and when school will “go back to normal.” We too wish we knew. Like many institutions, we’re preparing for the 2020–21 academic year with careful consideration and optimism.

<strong>Staff openings at the Outer Coast Year</strong>

As we lay the foundations for the Year — our first program for high school graduates —  we are excited to start our search for two significant hires:

[The Academic Life Coordinator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epkgNI1le5iWEtgpbrKKX8zEzo9UMsJhrREu_9rcWR0/edit) will support students in their academic pursuits by assisting faculty and refining Outer Coast’s pedagogical structures for the long term.

[The Residential Life Coordinator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KcfmbXKztxfmpBzblRpu1axEgIz_gR7DdpaId0vvZYA/edit) will support students in their lives outside the classroom by building meaningful relationships and fostering a safe and vibrant campus culture.

Both coordinators will play important mentorship roles in the lives of Year students and make lasting contributions to the Outer Coast project more broadly.

<strong>Outer Coast Year student application</strong>

Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we know many high school seniors are considering deferring their first year of college and some college students may be looking to take off a semester or all of next year. While we can’t know for certain what the future will hold, we're excited to offer an opportunity in Sitka for students looking to continue their education with a cohort of fewer than 20 others.

The deadline to apply for the Fall Semester or for the full Year is May 15, and we encourage all interested students to get started on their applications.

<strong>Who can apply?</strong>

- Graduating high school seniors
- Recent high school graduates with less than a Bachelor’s degree, including current college students.

The application is available online at [outercoast.org/year/apply](http://outercoast.org/year/apply/). Don’t hesitate to reach out to johnny@outercoast.org if you have any questions.

### Outer Coast Year 2020–21

The Outer Coast Year offers a diverse cohort of up to 20 Alaskan, Lower 48, and international high school graduates a transformative educational experience in Sitka, Alaska founded on the belief that students should have agency and ownership of every aspect of their academic and personal lives and the responsibility to positively affect the communities to which they belong.

Over the course of two four-month semesters, students immerse themselves in fast-paced, intellectually rigorous academic coursework; engage in work-based service and meaningful labor in Sitka; and practice self-governance of key aspects of the Outer Coast experience. Through small seminars, close-knit residential living, and involvement in the wider Sitka community, Outer Coast Year students will learn how to identify, analyze, and address the challenges — both big and small — that face the world today.

<strong>Academics:</strong>

During each semester, students will participate in two consecutive, seven-week, intellectually rigorous courses that introduce students to engaging, discussion-based learning. In small seminars, students must engage fully with the material, the faculty, and their peers. Students may have the option to receive grades and academic credit for their coursework.

<strong>Term 1 — Writing and Place: What is Home?</strong>

What does it mean to belong to a place? Can writing about a place make it home? Can reading about a place transport you there? In considering these questions, we'll read Alaskan authors to develop a relationship to the world around OCC, as well as non-Alaskans. By the end of the course, we will have new writing but also, hopefully, a richer relationship to the geographies we call home.

<strong>Term 2 — Humans and Other Animals</strong>

What does it mean to be human? Attempts to answer this question often draw comparisons with animals: we’re animals too, but animals of a very special kind. The aim of this course is to think about what we are as human beings by considering the way we think about our relation to other animals. Questions we’ll ask include: What relevant differences (if any) might distinguish us from other animals? How do categories like natural/unnatural or wild/domesticated shape our understanding of other animals, and how do they shape our understanding of ourselves? In what ways and to what extent can the sorts of relationships that exist between humans (e.g. friendship, political community, sexual love) exist between a human being and an animal of another species? And with these questions in mind, we’ll consider some of the uses to which animals are put—as food, as subjects of scientific experiments, as pets, etc.—and ask what sorts of limits we ought to draw to their use in these contexts. The readings for the course are intended as a springboard for investigations that will range beyond the texts and take good advantage of the Sitka community as well as our own diverse experiences with animals.

<strong>Term 3 — Political Philosophy</strong>

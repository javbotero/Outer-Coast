### Outer Coast Summer Seminar: Overview

The Outer Coast Summer Seminar offers a diverse cohort of Alaskan and Lower 48 high school students (current sophomores and juniors) a transformative academic and service based experience that is founded on the belief that students can and should participate in community governance. 

<strong>Program Dates</strong>

Saturday, June 29th - Saturday, August 3rd, 2019

<strong>Eligibility</strong>

Current high school sophomores and juniors are eligible to apply. We hope to bring together high-potential students who are invested in community. We place a special emphasis on recruiting students from underserved backgrounds.

<strong>Location</strong>

The Summer Seminar is hosted on the Mt. Edgecumbe High School and Sitka Fine Arts Camp campuses in Sitka, Alaska. Students live in community with their peers alongside Residential Teaching Assistants.

<strong>Educational Model</strong>

Over the course of five weeks, students immerse themselves in two fast-paced, college-level academic courses; participate in a meaningful, work-based service program; and explore the powers and responsibilities of self-governance. Both inside and outside the classroom, Summer Seminar students will learn how to identify, analyze, and respond to the challenges that face the world today.
